# Breast Cancer Detection System - Production Ready

## Overview
A production-ready breast cancer detection system using multiple deep learning models with safety measures to prevent false positives.

## Features
- **Multiple Models**: ResNet18, EfficientNetB3, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, VGG16
- **Safety Measures**: Automatic detection and prevention of false positives on random/dumb images
- **Production Testing**: Comprehensive testing suite for deployment validation
- **Web Interface**: Streamlit-based user interface

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
streamlit run app_fixed.py
```

### 3. Test Models
```bash
python test_models_independently.py
```

### 4. Production Testing
```bash
python production_test_suite.py
```

## Model Information
- **ResNet18**: Fast, reliable predictions
- **EfficientNetB3**: Balanced accuracy and speed
- **DenseNet121**: High accuracy with dense connections
- **MobileNetV2**: Lightweight, mobile-friendly
- **VGG16**: Classic architecture with good performance

## Safety Features
- Automatic detection of random noise and solid color images
- Confidence thresholds to prevent low-confidence predictions
- Multiple validation layers for cancer predictions
